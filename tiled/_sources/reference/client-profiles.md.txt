# Client Profiles Reference

This is a comprehensive reference. See also {doc}`../how-to/profiles` for a
practical guide with examples.

A profiles YAML file must contain a mapping with one or more keys.
The keys may be any string. The value of each entry is described below.

The content below is automatically generated from a schema that is used
to validate profiles when they are read.
(schema_uri)=
## uri

URI of a Tiled server, such as

    http://localhost:8000


(schema_username)=
## username

For authenticated Trees. Optional unless the Tree requires authentication.


(schema_auth_provider)=
## auth_provider

Authentication provider. If unspecified and there are multiple providers
supported by the server, the client will prompt the user to choose one.


(schema_headers)=
## headers

Extra HTTP headers


(schema_offline)=
## offline

False by default. When true, rely solely on cache. Do not attempt to connect to server.


(schema_direct)=
## direct

In-line service configuration. See Service Configuration reference.

(schema_structure_clients)=
## structure_clients

Client to read structure into.
Default ("numpy") uses numpy arrays, pandas DataFrames, and xarrays backed
by numpy arrays.

```yaml
structure_clients: "numpy"
```

The "dask" option uses the dask-based analogues of
these.

```yaml
structure_clients: "dask"
```

To use custom clients, map each structure family or spec you want to support
to an import path:

```yaml
structure_clients:
  array: "package.module:CustomArrayClient"
  dataframe: "package.module:CustomDataFrameClient"
  my_custom_spec: "package.module:CUstomClient"
```


(schema_cache)=
## cache

(schema_cache.memory)=
### cache.memory

(schema_cache.memory.capacity)=
#### cache.memory.capacity

Maximum memory (in bytes) that the cache may consume.

For readability it is recommended to use `_` for thousands separators.
Example:

```yaml
available_bytes: 2_000_000_000  # 2GB
```


(schema_cache.memory.available_bytes)=
#### cache.memory.available_bytes

Deprecated alias for "capacity"

(schema_cache.disk)=
### cache.disk

(schema_cache.disk.path)=
#### cache.disk.path

A directory will be created at this path if it does not yet exist.
It is safe to reuse an existing cache directory and to share a cache
directory between multiple processes.
available_bytes:


(schema_cache.disk.capacity)=
#### cache.disk.capacity

Maximum storage space (in bytes) that the cache may consume.

For readability it is recommended to use `_` for thousands separators.
Example:

```yaml
available_bytes: 2_000_000_000  # 2GB
```


(schema_cache.disk.available_bytes)=
#### cache.disk.available_bytes

Deprecated alias for "capacity"

(schema_token_cache)=
## token_cache

Filepath to directory of access tokens.
Default location is usually suitable.
The default is system-dependent and can be inspected at
`tiled.client.context.DEFAULT_TOKEN_CACHE`.


(schema_verify)=
## verify

Set to False to disable SSL verification.
