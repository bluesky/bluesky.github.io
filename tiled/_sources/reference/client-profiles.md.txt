# Client Profiles Reference

This is a comprehensive reference. See also {doc}`../how-to/profiles` for a
practical guide with examples.

A profiles YAML file must contain a mapping with one or more keys.
The keys may be any string. The value of each entry is described below.

The content below is automatically generated from a schema that is used
to validate profiles when they are read.
(schema_uri)=
## uri

URI of a Tiled server, such as

    http://localhost:8000


(schema_username)=
## username

For authenticated Trees. Optional unless the Tree requires authentication.


(schema_auth_provider)=
## auth_provider

Authentication provider. If unspecified and there are multiple providers
supported by the server, the client will prompt the user to choose one.


(schema_headers)=
## headers

Extra HTTP headers


(schema_direct)=
## direct

In-line service configuration. See Service Configuration reference.

(schema_structure_clients)=
## structure_clients

Client to read structure into.
Default ("numpy") uses numpy arrays, pandas DataFrames, and xarrays backed
by numpy arrays.

```yaml
structure_clients: "numpy"
```

The "dask" option uses the dask-based analogues of
these.

```yaml
structure_clients: "dask"
```

To use custom clients, map each structure family or spec you want to support
to an import path:

```yaml
structure_clients:
  array: "package.module:CustomArrayClient"
  dataframe: "package.module:CustomDataFrameClient"
  my_custom_spec: "package.module:CUstomClient"
```


(schema_cache)=
## cache

(schema_cache.filepath)=
### cache.filepath

Location of cache file on disk.
Default location is `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/tiled/http_response_cache.db`.


(schema_cache.capacity)=
### cache.capacity

Maximum size (in bytes) that the cache may allocate for response bodies.
The total size of a cache may be slightly higher. Default is 500 MB.

For readability it is recommended to use `_` for thousands separators.
Example:

```yaml
capacity: 500_000_000  # 500 MB
```


(schema_cache.max_item_size)=
### cache.max_item_size

Maximum size (in bytes) of any individual cached response body.
This limit is designed to prevent one a couple very large responses from
using up the entire capacity.

For readability it is recommended to use `_` for thousands separators.
Example:

```yaml
capacity: 500_000  # 500 kB
```


(schema_cache.readonly)=
### cache.readonly

Open the cache in read-only mode.
Do not add, remove, or update contents.


(schema_timeout)=
## timeout

Configure timeouts for the HTTP client.

Tiled sets read and write timeouts very high (30 seconds) by default to
accommodate pulling ~100 MB chunks over a slow network connection.

Units are seconds.
For details see https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/#timeout-configuration


(schema_timeout.connection)=
### timeout.connection

(schema_timeout.read)=
### timeout.read

(schema_timeout.write)=
### timeout.write

(schema_timeout.pool)=
### timeout.pool

(schema_token_cache)=
## token_cache

Filepath to directory of access tokens.
Default location is usually suitable. It is in the tokens
subdirectory of `TILED_CACHE_DIR`, which is
system-dependent and can be inspected at
`tiled.client.context.TILED_CACHE_DIR`.


(schema_verify)=
## verify

Set to False to disable SSL verification.
