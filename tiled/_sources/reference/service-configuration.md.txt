# Service Configuration Reference

This is a comprehensive reference. See also {doc}`../how-to/configuration` for a
practical guide with examples.

## Configuration merging rules

If there are multiple configuration files:

* At most one may contain an ``authentication:`` section.
* More than one may contain a ``tree:`` section, but if the same ``path``
  occurs in more than one file, or if colliding paths like ``/a`` and ``/a/b``
  are specified, an exception will be raised.
* If there is more than one ``allow_origins`` section their contents are merged.
* The behavior of other top-level collisions are currently undefined and will
  likely be made strict in the future.

The content below is automatically generated from a schema that is used
to validate configuration files when they are read.

## Environment variable expansion

Any values with environment variables, given as `$VAR` or `${VAR}`, will be
expanded (i.e. filled in) with their values.
(schema_trees)=
## trees

This section contains a *list* of one or more items,
each describing a Tree to be served.


(schema_trees.tree)=
### trees[item].tree

Type of tree to serve. This may be:

- The string `files`, a shorthand for serving a directory of files.
- An import path to a Tree *instance*.
- An import path to a callable (function or type) that returns a
  Tree. For these, the `args:` parameter below must be used as well.

In an import path, packages/modules are separated by dots,
and the object itself it separated by a colon.

Examples:

    # Tree instances
    tiled.examples.generated_minimal:tree
    tiled examples.generated:tree
    my_python_module:my_tree_instance

    # Callables that return Tree instances
    tiled.adapters.files:DirectoryAdapter.from_directory
    my_python_module:CustomTree


(schema_trees.path)=
### trees[item].path

URL subpath for to serve this Tree on.
A good default choice is `"/"` if you are serving
one Tree.


(schema_trees.args)=
### trees[item].args

If `tree:` is set to `files` or some callable that returns a
Tree, this parameter must be included. It may contain named
arguments to pass to the callable. It may be empty or `null` if the
callable requires no arguments.

Example:

```yaml
- path: "/"
  tree: tiled.adapters.files:DirectoryAdapter.from_directory
  args:
    directory: "path/to/files"
```


(schema_trees.access_control)=
### trees[item].access_control

AccessPolicy object encoding rules for which users can see which entries.
If this is set (not null) then an authenticator must also be set.

Example:

```yaml
access_control:
  access_policy: "tiled.adapters.mapping:SimpleAccessPolicy"
  args:
    access_lists:
      alice: ["A", "B"]
      bob: ["C"]
      cara: "tiled.adapters.mapping:SimpleAccessPolicy.ALL"
```


(schema_trees.access_control.args)=
#### trees.access_control.args

Given as a media type (a.k.a MIME type) mapped to an importable function,
as in

```yaml
application/x-my-custom-format: package.module:exporter_function
```


(schema_media_types.dataframe)=
### media_types.dataframe

Additional exporters (a.k.a. serializers) for dataframe structures.

Given as a media type (a.k.a MIME type) mapped to an importable function,
as in

```yaml
application/x-my-custom-format: package.module:exporter_function
```


(schema_media_types.dataset)=
### media_types.dataset

Additional exporters (a.k.a. serializers) for xarray dataset structures.


Given as a media type (a.k.a MIME type) mapped to an importable function,
as in

```yaml
application/x-my-custom-format: package.module:exporter_function
```


(schema_file_extensions)=
## file_extensions

This supports the convenience alias `?format=ext` to request a format
corresponding to some file extension `ext`.

Contents should map file extension to a media type (a.k.a MIME type) as in

```
ext: application/x-my-custom-format
```


(schema_authentication)=
## authentication

This section describes whether and how to authenticate users.

(schema_authentication.providers)=
### authentication.providers

(schema_authentication.tiled_admins)=
### authentication.tiled_admins

Give users with these identities 'admin' Role.


(schema_authentication.tiled_admins.provider)=
#### authentication.tiled_admins[item].provider

(schema_authentication.tiled_admins.id)=
#### authentication.tiled_admins[item].id

(schema_authentication.secret_keys)=
### authentication.secret_keys

Secret keys used to sign secure tokens.

When generating a secret, is important to produce a difficult-to-guess
random number, and make it different each time you start up a server.
Two equally good ways to generate a secure secret...

With ``openssl``:

    openssl rand -hex 32

With ``python``:

    python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"


(schema_authentication.allow_anonymous_access)=
### authentication.allow_anonymous_access

If true, allow unauthenticated, public access to any entries
that are not specifically controlled with an access policy.

Default is false.


(schema_authentication.single_user_api_key)=
### authentication.single_user_api_key

Secret API key used in single-user deployments.

When generating a secret, is important to produce a difficult-to-guess
random number, and make it different each time you start up a server.
Two equally good ways to generate a secure secret...

With ``openssl``:

    openssl rand -hex 32

With ``python``:

    python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"


(schema_authentication.access_token_max_age)=
### authentication.access_token_max_age

This controls how often fresh access token have to be
re-issued. The process is transparent to the user and just affects performance.
An *access* token cannot be revoked, so its lifetime should be short. The
default is 900 seconds (15 minutes).

Units are **seconds**.


(schema_authentication.refresh_token_max_age)=
### authentication.refresh_token_max_age

Time after which inactive sessions
(sessions that have not refreshed tokens) will time out.
Default is

Units are **seconds**.


(schema_authentication.session_max_age)=
### authentication.session_max_age

Even *active* sessions are timed out after this
limit, and the user is required to resubmit credentials. By default,
this is unset and active session are never shut down.


(schema_database)=
## database

(schema_database.uri)=
### database.uri

When Tiled is configured with authentication providers, it uses a SQL database
to persist information related to identities, sessions, and keys. (When it is
used without authentication providers, no database is used.)

If Tiled is configured with authentication providers above but a database
URI is not specified, `sqlite:///./tiled.sqlite` (i.e. a SQLite database in
the current working directory) will be used.

Tiled officially supports PostgreSQL and SQLite, but any database engine
supported by SQLAlchemy *may* work.


(schema_database.pool_pre_ping)=
### database.pool_pre_ping

If true (default), use pessimistic connection testings. This is recommended.


(schema_database.pool_size)=
### database.pool_size

Connection pool size. Default is 5. Minimum is 2.

(schema_database.max_overflow)=
### database.max_overflow

Connection pool max overflow. Default is 5.

(schema_access_control)=
## access_control

This section describes which users can see which entries.


(schema_access_control.access_policy)=
### access_control.access_policy

AccessPolicy object encoding rules for which users can see which entries.
If this is set (not null) then an authenticator must also be set.

Example:

```yaml
access_control:
  access_policy: "tiled.adapters.mapping:SimpleAccessPolicy"
  args:
    access_lists:
      alice: ["A", "B"]
      bob: ["C"]
      cara: "tiled.adapters.mapping:SimpleAccessPolicy.ALL"
```


(schema_access_control.args)=
### access_control.args

(schema_object_cache)=

Maximum size for the object cache, given as a number of bytes as in
1_000_000 or as a fraction of system RAM (total physical memory) as in
0.3. Set to 0 to disable this cache. By default, it will use up to
0.15 (15%) of RAM.


(schema_object_cache.log_level)=
### object_cache.log_level

Set to "debug" level to log cache hits, misses, and stores.
Default is "info" level, which logs cache configuration at application startup.


(schema_response_bytesize_limit)=
## response_bytesize_limit

Maximum byte size of a response, given in bytes. The default is low (300 MB) keeping
in mind that data is read into server memory and should generally be fetched in chunks.


(schema_allow_origins)=
## allow_origins

This list of domains enables web apps served from other domains to make
requests to the tiled serve.

Example:

```yaml
allow_origins:
  - https://chart-studio.plotly.com
```
